If you would like to have an offline copy of the documentation in you repository, run the following command after cloning to initialise the docs submodule:

`git submodule update --init --recursive`

## Pushing Documentation

If any offline edits are made that should be pushed to the GitHub Wiki, run the following command:

1. `cd docs`
2. If you have added new files and want to commit them all: `git add --all`
3. `git commit -a -m "Your commit message here"`
4. `git push origin HEAD:master`
